			<p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni has been India's most succesful captain in limited overs cricket and also his captaincy record in tests in the subcontinent.Unluckily,he couldn't get the same success in tests in SENA countries.The best finisher the game has ever had with a superb average of above 50 in odi cricket and the most runs a batsman has ever scored batting in the lower middle order with a mammoth 10773 runs in odi cricket.</p>

			<p>Rohit Sharma made his debut way back in 2007,but he was not consistent enough till 2012.But since Dhoni made him open the batting in 2013 things changed for him.Only batsman with 3 double hundreds in odi cricket,an epic record.Also in the last 2-3 years he has been the highest run scorer in odi cricket for India.He is also the only Indian with multiple hundreds in T20I cricket.</p>

			<p>Virat Kohli,a phenomenal batsman in all the 3 formats of the game.In fact he is the one who seems to break the record of 100 centuries in international cricket. He has a great record in all conditions in the whole world,be it Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, West Indies and the subcontinent.He is now the captain of India after Dhoni decided to give up captaincy in 2017.</p>
